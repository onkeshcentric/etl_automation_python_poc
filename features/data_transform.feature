  Sample tests for ETL testing POC

#  Scenario: Check count between source and destination
#    Given I connect to source and destination databases
#    Then I fetch count for "claims" table from "source" database
#    Then I fetch count for "reports" table from "destination" database
#    Then I validate the count between tables "claims" and "reports"
